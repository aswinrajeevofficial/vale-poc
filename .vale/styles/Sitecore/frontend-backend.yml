message: Always write as two words, and hyphenate them if used as an adjective - for
  example, a back-end e-commerce system. Don't use these terms in business user documentation.
  Instead of front end - use portal, interface, page, website, and so on. Instead
  of back end - use the product or feature name, such as Content Editor, User Manager,
  Media Library, and so on.
