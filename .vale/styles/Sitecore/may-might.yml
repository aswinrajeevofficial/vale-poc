message: 'Avoid using may when you want to talk about the possibility of something.
  Use might instead. Avoid using may when you want to talk about permission, or the
  ability to do something. Use can instead. May is potentially confusing for non-native
  English speakers, because it can express that something is possible, but can also
  give permission to do something. For example: customer form entries may contain
  personal data. It is not clear whether this means it is possible that (some) form
  entries contain personal data, or it is permitted for any form entry to contain
  personal data.'
